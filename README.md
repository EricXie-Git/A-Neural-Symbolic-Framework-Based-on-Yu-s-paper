# A Neural Symbolic Framework and BPGR on VRD

A neural symbolic framework based on Yu's paper 《基于统计关系学习的神经符号系统研究》  

We borrowed part of the framework from [Large-Scale-VRD.pytorch](https://github.com/jz462/Large-Scale-VRD.pytorch) **and** [NSF-SRL](https://github.com/Dongranyu/NSF-SRL) for this project, so there are a lot overlaps between these and ours.
